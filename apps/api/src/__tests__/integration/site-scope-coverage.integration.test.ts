/**
 * Contract test: every per-device route under `apps/api/src/routes` must
 * apply a site-scope gate so that partner-scope users restricted to a
 * subset of sites within an org cannot read or mutate devices in other
 * sites. Site is an app-layer concept only — Postgres RLS does NOT defend
 * it — so any route handler that resolves `/:deviceId` from the URL without
 * checking `permissions.allowedSiteIds` is a cross-site escalation vector.
 *
 * The scanner ({@link findRoutesTouchingDevices}) walks every `.ts` file
 * under `routes/`, matches Hono route definitions whose URL pattern names
 * a device explicitly (`:deviceId` / `:deviceIds` / `:device_id`), and
 * checks that the handler body (or a file-local helper called from it)
 * references one of the canonical site-scope gates:
 *
 *   - `requireSiteAccess`             middleware (`middleware/auth.ts`)
 *   - `canAccessDeviceSite`           per-file helper convention
 *   - `getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck`  canonical helper (`routes/devices/helpers.ts`)
 *   - `canAccessSite`                 underlying primitive (`services/permissions.ts`)
 *
 * The allowlist below captures the set of routes that were known to be
 * missing the gate as of the SP2 sweep that added this test (PR #864/#868
 * fixed the bulk; this PR closes the audit-found cisHardening + software
 * inventory routes). New entries to the allowlist must include a comment
 * explaining why the site-scope check is intentionally absent or being
 * deferred — the default action on a new failure is to fix the handler,
 * not extend the allowlist.
 *
 * NOTE: this test only catches per-device URL patterns. Handlers that take
 * a `deviceId` via query/body filter are still vulnerable to the same
 * class of bug; those are caught by route-level reviews and the targeted
 * tests under `__tests__/multi-tenant-isolation.test.ts`. The list-style
 * software inventory route (`GET /software/inventory?deviceId=…`) was
 * also fixed in this PR via direct audit rather than via this scanner.

 * Third detector: DEAD permissions-sourced site gates. This is the blind spot

 * *runs*: the fail-open idiom
 *
 *     const perms = c.get('permissions');
 *     if (perms?.allowedSiteIds && !canAccessSite(perms, device.siteId)) deny();
 *
 * reads `permissions` from the request context — which is populated ONLY by
 * `requirePermission` middleware (`middleware/auth.ts` does
 * `c.set('permissions', …)`), NEVER by `authMiddleware`/`requireScope`. A route
 * carrying only `requireScope` leaves `perms` `undefined`, so `perms?.…` is
 * falsy, the guard is skipped, and a site-restricted partner user reads/writes
 * out-of-site devices. The gate text is present (so the detectors above pass),
 * but it is dead. The original scanner treated `canAccessSite`/`allowedSiteIds`
 * as proof of a gate; this detector additionally requires a LIVE source for the
 * `permissions` context.
 *
 * {@link findRoutesWithDeadPermsSiteGate} flags a route when its handler — or a
 * file-local helper it calls — gates on the `permissions` context with no live
 * source (`requirePermission(` in the chain, a `getUserPermissions(` fallback,
 * or self-resolving `requireSiteAccess`). Fail-closed helpers that THROW on a
 * missing context (`getDeviceWithOrgAndSiteCheck`) are excluded — they break
 * the request rather than leak.
 *
 * Routes that legitimately gate via `getUserPermissions` fallback are NOT
 * flagged — e.g. `routes/security/{posture,status,threats}.ts`, which fetch
 * permissions themselves (PR #900) and so stay live under plain `requireScope`.
