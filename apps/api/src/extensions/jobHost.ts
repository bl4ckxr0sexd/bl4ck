/**
 * BullMQ job host for runtime extensions.
 *
 * One `breeze-extension-jobs` Queue + Worker serves every active extension's
 * cron jobs. Repeatable schedules use stable jobIds (`extension:<name>:<job>`)
 * and BullMQ cron patterns, so scheduling is multi-replica-dedup'd exactly like
 * the audit-retention worker.
 *
 * The processor is deliberately defensive:
 *   • it resolves the CURRENT active registry snapshot per run (never a stale
 *     closure), so a redeployed handler is picked up;
 *   • it re-checks `installed_extensions.enabled` (via the state store, which
 *     wraps the read in system DB scope) and SKIPS a claimed job for a disabled
 *     extension — it does NOT cancel an already-running handler, it just refuses
 *     to start a new one;
 *   • it lets handler errors PROPAGATE to BullMQ's retry machinery (never
 *     swallows them) while still recording an outcome metric.

   *
   * Staleness is decided on the FULL repeatable identity `(name, id, pattern)`,
   * not on the jobId alone. BullMQ keys a repeatable by its whole option set
   * (`name:jobId:endDate:tz:pattern`), so a cron-pattern change or a job rename

   * change. Same rationale as `jobs/auditRetention.ts`.
   *
   * The desired set is `listActive()` INTERSECTED with the durable `enabled`
   * flag. `listActive()` alone reflects only this replica's in-memory snapshot,
   * so a replica that never saw the disable would re-add the disabled
   * extension's repeatables on its next sync — permanently, since nothing else
   * converges it. Reading the flag makes any replica's sync produce the same
   * desired set.
   *
   * REMOVAL is additionally scoped to extensions THIS replica knows about, so a
   * sync here can never delete a schedule owned by an extension that only
   * another replica activated — unless the state store POSITIVELY confirms the
   * owner has no `installed_extensions` row at all. See the removal loop.
