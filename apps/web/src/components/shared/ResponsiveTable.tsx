/**
 * Responsive data-table container.
 *
 * Above the `sm` breakpoint it renders a horizontally *scrollable* table. The
 * tables across monitoring/discovery previously used `overflow-hidden`, which
 * silently clips right-hand columns (Type, status, Actions) on any viewport
 * narrower than the table — the exact defect mobile users reported. `overflow-x-auto`
 * keeps every column reachable on tablet/narrow-desktop.
 *
 * Below `sm` the table is hidden entirely and a stacked card list is shown,
 * because a 6–7 column table never reads well on a phone no matter how it scrolls.
 *
 * Each surface supplies its own `table` and `cards` because cell content is
 * heterogeneous (status pills, button groups, nested host metadata); this
 * primitive owns only the responsive switch, the scroll fallback, and a
 * consistent breakpoint so the converted tables can't drift apart again.
 *
 * The two surfaces are typed as independent `ReactNode`s, so their parity (same
 * rows, same data, same actions) is enforced by convention — each call site
 * extracts shared `renderX(row)` helpers used by both — plus tests, not by the
 * type system. That is deliberate: a column-config/render-prop API would turn
 * parity into a type guarantee but leak across 13+ heterogeneous call sites.
