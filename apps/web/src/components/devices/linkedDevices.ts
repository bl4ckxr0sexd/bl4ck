/**
 * Linked device profiles for multi-boot systems (#2138) — v2 presentation.
 *
 * A physical machine that dual/multi-boots runs one Breeze agent per OS, so the
 * same hardware appears as several device records — only one can be online at a
 * time. Every record is a fully managed endpoint, so NOTHING is collapsed away
 * or hidden (that was v1's mistake, PR #2186). Instead, `groupLinkedDevices`
 * computes a per-page display plan:
 *
 * - Exactly ONE member of a link group online on this page → the online member
 *   renders as a normal full row and each offline sibling attaches beneath it
 *   as a thin muted "expected offline" strip (still clickable through to that
 *   device's detail page, still visible, just de-emphasized).
 * - ALL members offline → all render as normal full rows, each marked with a
 *   subtle left-edge group bar (`offlineGroup`). No primary election.
 * - TWO OR MORE members online → all render as normal full rows (no conflict
 *   state; deliberately designed out).
 *
 * VM-host groups (#2308) are the ASYMMETRIC sibling of the above: one member
 * is the host server (`linkGroupRole === 'host'`), the rest are its guest VMs
 * (`'guest'`). Host + guests are concurrently online, so none of the multiboot
 * expected-offline treatment applies. Instead, guest rows are reordered to sit
 * directly beneath their host and marked (`vmRole`/`vmGroupId`) so DeviceList
 * can indent them and offer an expand/collapse affordance on the host row.
 * Guests stay FULL rows — selectable, bulk-op visible, every column rendered.
 * A non-null role implies the group kind is 'vm_host' (the list API sends the
 * role scalar precisely so no group-table join/fetch is needed here). When the
 * host is not on this page (pagination split / filtered out), its guests
 * render as normal ungrouped rows — same caveat as multiboot.
 *
 * Grouping is computed CLIENT-SIDE within the given page slice. Accepted
 * caveat: siblings split across a pagination boundary render ungrouped on that
 * page (a group needs 2+ members present to group at all).
