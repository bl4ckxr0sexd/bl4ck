# SOC Remaining Controls Walkthrough (BL4CK)

Last updated: 2026-02-28

## Purpose

Step through the remaining SOC controls in one place with:

- plain-English meaning
- BL4CK implementation starting point
- immediate next step for evidence readiness

## Assumptions

- Uses SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria control ID format (CC/A/C/PI/P) commonly used in SOC 2 programs.
- `A1.1-A1.3` and `C1.1-C1.2` are already documented separately.
- Final in-scope control set must be confirmed with your auditor and report scope (especially Privacy criteria).

## Already Covered

- Availability:
  - `docs/notes/SOC_A1.1_CAPACITY_NOTES.md`
  - `docs/notes/SOC_A1.2_RECOVERY_OBJECTIVES_NOTES.md`
  - `docs/notes/SOC_A1.3_RECOVERY_TESTING_NOTES.md`
- Confidentiality:
  - `docs/notes/SOC_C1.1_CONFIDENTIAL_DATA_IDENTIFICATION_NOTES.md`
  - `docs/notes/SOC_C1.2_CONFIDENTIAL_DATA_DISPOSAL_NOTES.md`

## Suggested Execution Order

1. Complete all Security Common Criteria (`CC1.x` to `CC9.x`) evidence foundations.
2. Finalize Availability and Confidentiality evidence operation (already drafted).
3. If included in scope, implement Processing Integrity control evidence.
4. If included in scope, define Privacy program boundaries and DSAR/privacy workflows.

## Evidence Packaging Tip

Use one evidence index per domain:

- `SOC_SECURITY_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`
- `SOC_AVAILABILITY_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` (already created)
- `SOC_CONFIDENTIALITY_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`
- `SOC_PROCESSING_INTEGRITY_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` (if in scope)
- `SOC_PRIVACY_EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` (if in scope)
