.SYNOPSIS
    Install BL4CK Agent user helper as a Windows Scheduled Task.
.DESCRIPTION
    Registers the user helper scheduled task so it auto-starts for each user at login.

    Failure diagnostics: when this script fails, the MSI rolls back with
    "installer rolled back" and no actionable text in the default MSI log.
    To preserve the cause, every error path writes a single-line timestamped
    record to C:\ProgramData\BL4CK\logs\user-helper-install-last-error.txt
    (survives the rollback because CA-written files are opaque to MSI) and
    emits an Event Viewer entry under Application/Bl4ckAgent. This mirrors
    the enrollment CA's diagnostic trail.
