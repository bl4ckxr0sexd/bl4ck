// the assertion is held (newly taken or already held from a prior call), 0 if
// macOS declined to provide one.
//
// Option choice — NSActivityUserInitiatedAllowingIdleSystemSleep:
//   * It suppresses App Nap and sudden/automatic termination, which is the
//     behavior that was suspending the helper. A suspended helper stops
//     answering the broker's keepalive pings, so the broker closes the session
//     once no pong has arrived within its ~45s keepalive timeout (observed in
//     the field as a ~60s eviction age, since the broker only checks on its
//     30s ping tick).
//   * It deliberately does NOT set NSActivityIdleSystemSleepDisabled. The
//     helper is an always-on background LaunchAgent; holding an
//     idle-system-sleep-disabling assertion for the entire process lifetime
//     would stop a laptop from ever idle-sleeping and needlessly drain the
//     battery. Normal system sleep (idle timeout, lid close) is still allowed;
//     when the machine sleeps the broker sleeps with it, so no keepalive is
//     due anyway.
