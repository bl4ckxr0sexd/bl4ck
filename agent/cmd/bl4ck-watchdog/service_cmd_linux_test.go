// TestWatchdogUnitDeclaresRuntimeDirectory guards the #1297 fix on the watchdog.
//
// Unlike the agent (which is intentionally unsandboxed since #1197), the
// watchdog stays hardened: ProtectSystem=strict + ReadWritePaths=/var/run/bl4ck.
// systemd builds that mount namespace by bind-mounting every ReadWritePaths
// entry, which REQUIRES the path to already exist. /run is tmpfs and wiped on
// reboot, so on a host whose tmpfiles.d snippet was never installed /run/bl4ck
// is absent at boot and the watchdog fails sandbox setup with 226/NAMESPACE —
// the same wedge the agent hit before #1197. With both the agent and the
// watchdog wedged, nothing on the host can self-heal.
//
// RuntimeDirectory=breeze makes systemd create /run/bl4ck BEFORE building the
// namespace, eliminating that dependency. systemd reference-counts the runtime
// directory across bl4ck-agent + bl4ck-watchdog, so it persists while either
// unit is active.
