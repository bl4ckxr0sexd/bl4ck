// TestDoUpdateWatchdogFollowsFailoverBaseURLPromotion is the #2478 regression
// guard for the watchdog binary updater. doUpdateWatchdog (and its identically
// wired sibling doUpdateAgent) must resolve the control-plane URL from the live
// provider — the FailoverClient's BaseURL — at download time, NOT from the
// cfg.ServerURL copy captured at startup. Before the fix the updater built
// updater.Config{ServerURL: cfg.ServerURL} and therefore kept downloading from
// the dead primary even after the FailoverClient had retargeted itself to the
// promoted backup via SetBaseURL during a failover window.
//
// doUpdateWatchdog is used (rather than doUpdateAgent) because it derives its
// BinaryPath from os.Executable() — the test binary, in a writable temp dir — so
// the updater's write-preflight passes and the download actually routes over
// HTTP where the two servers below can observe which origin was contacted.
// doUpdateAgent shares the exact same serverURL wiring, so this proves the class.
